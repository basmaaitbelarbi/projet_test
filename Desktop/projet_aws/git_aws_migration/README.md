#### Project description:

Our project is about implementing an end-to-end Sales Dashboard and Analytics workflow that involves storing sales data in an Amazon RDS for SQL Server instance, analyzing it with SQL queries, and visualizing key metrics through interactive dashboards.

Steps:

1. Data Modeling and Ingestion:

    - Creating our database instance (Amazon RDS for SQL Server)

    - Designing and creating tables/schemas for our sales data

    - Ingesting (importing) data into these tables

2. Querying and Analytics (Preparing queries)

3. Visualization and Dashboards (Using Amazon QuickSight and Tableau with scheduling data refreshes for real-time insights)
